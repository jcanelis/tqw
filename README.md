## TrackQueen website ðŸ’¿ ðŸ‘‘

Learn more about your music. TrackQueen gives you analysis, background info, comments, lyrics, videos and other content about your currently playing song.

### Overview

The marketing website for TrackQueen is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) using React. [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) is used to manage most of the content. Some Google [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) are made available using Node.js with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). These function endpoints are used to send text messages with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and emails with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). GitHub pull releases will generate a preview URL and anything merged will ship to production after running a quick lint and build check using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
